## Showme
Showme is a lightweight React library built on top of **rrweb** that lets end users *self-initiate* session recordings to report bugs. Unlike automated replay tools, recordings start only when users opt-in during errors, ensuring privacy-first troubleshooting.

# Introduction
Support teams need to independently assess issues, but permissive request forms and incomplete user input rarely provide sufficient context. This lack of clarity disrupts troubleshooting efficiency, bloats technical teamsâ€™ backlog, undermines SLA adherence, and ultimately drives customer churn and dissatisfaction.

Showme offers **user-initiated session recordings as a direct support channel**. By capturing a visual reconstruction of the issue alongside console logs and network calls, support and technical teams enjoy precise and actionable insights. This approach accelerates troubleshooting, enhances SLA compliance, and boosts customer satisfaction by minimizing back-and-forth interactions.
